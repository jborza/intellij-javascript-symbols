# What is this for?

In JavaScript we quite often use strings as some kind of identifiers. Event and module names are good examples here.
 
A good IDE should support this in my opinion. With this plugin on board each JavaScript string
 in format ':hyphen-identifier' becomes a 'symbol' which you can rename(Shift + F6) or find usages of (Alt + F7).
